Some updates:
- our lab is a member of the [Rosetta Commons](https://www.rosettacommons.org/)
- we had some lab renovations and got equipment
- our first two rotation students, Kyle Helms and Julia Urban, joined us in January and left us in April. We miss them and their fantastic science
- our next batch of rotation students, Andrew Reckers and Belen Sundberg, joined us in April. They are really awesome
- after optimizing and troubleshooting for a couple months, Malcolm collected our first large HDX/MS datasets (shoutout to the world-class [ASRC MS facility](https://asrc.gc.cuny.edu/structbio/)!!)
- Daniel got an Amgen scholarship for summer research
- Daniel, Kyle W. and Anum completed Columbia's [Lab-to-Market bootcamp](https://www.irvinginstitute.columbia.edu/services/life-science-accelerator-lab-market-boot-camp) - here's a 1-min video about our project

- we applied for grants
- we all gave our first group meetings
- Daniel and Kyle W. learned a lot at pyrosetta bootcamp
