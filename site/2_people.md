I am an assistant professor at Columbia University Medical Center in the [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics](https://www.biochem.cuimc.columbia.edu/). I grew up on the Jersey Shore. As an undergraduate in the [Gracias Lab](https://graciaslab.johnshopkins.edu/), I built self-folding micro-structures. In graduate school, I studied nature's most beautiful self-folding systems -- proteins -- in the [DTE Lab](https://dtelab.northwestern.edu/) at UC Berkeley. For the last few years, I moved into computational biophysics to design new proteins for artifical functions as a postdoctoral fellow in the [Kortemme Lab](http://kortemmelab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF. I am so pumped to do protein science in NYC!!

I am a third-year undergraduate student working towards a B.A. in Biochemistry. I was born in Bógota, Colombia, and moved to the US 6 years ago. I lived in Miami, Florida, and obtained my Associate Degree in chemistry at Miami Dade College. There, I worked with Dr. Juan Morata where I became fascinated with viruses and their ability to hack biological mechanisms. Currently, I am learning about protein engineering and computational biology; I am extremely excited to keep studying proteins! Outside the lab, I enjoy reading, playing, and developing videogames, skateboarding, and museums!

I am a PhD student in the Integrated Program hailing from California. I obtained my bachelor’s degree from Whitman College, where I studied Environmental Studies and Biology. Most recently, I was a research technician in Dr. Roy Gerona’s lab at UC San Francisco, using mass spectrometry to study forensic toxicology and antibiotic therapy adherence. I am interested in cool proteins and cool science!

I was born and raised in Richardson, TX. I am currently a freshman undergraduate at Columbia University majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I have prior research experience with molecular dynamics simulations and solvation chemistry. I am currently working on PARROTS, a pipeline for rapidly engineering antiviral therapeutics. Outside of research, I love eating strawberries, playing tennis, lifting weights, and taking long walks.

I am a first year PhD student in the Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular, and Biomedical Studies at Columbia University. Before beginning my PhD, I received my B.A. in Biology from NYU and worked as a technician at Columbia’s Chio Laboratory, investigating redox adaptations acquired by Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma cells to survive persistent oxidative stress. I am very excited to investigate the effects of cancer-associated mutations on allosteric regulation in a key glycolytic enzyme, PFK1, and dive into the world of computational biology during my rotation at the Glasgow Lab!

I am currently a Research Assistant in the Glasgow lab and soon to be PhD student in the Integrated Program of Cellular, Molecular, and Biomedical Studies at Columbia. I received my bachelor’s degree from the University of Florida in Biotechnology as well as a minor in Bioinformatics. My previous research focused on mitigating the effects of citrus greening, a bacterial pathogenic infection, in citrus plants. I specialized in RNA-Seq experiments, genome assemblies, and isoform discovery to uncover mechanisms of resistance. My current interests are in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. I wish to create novel enzymes and transcription factors for the use in synthetic systems.

I am a second-year PhD student in physics at Columbia. I did my undergrad also in physics at Columbia, and before starting here I did research in condensed matter physics and genomics labs. I am excited about protein biophysics and currently studying allostery using HDX mass spectrometry.
